<h1>Application Design Project - Translator Demo App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project consists of designing and creating a software application that encourages and helps to access and learn a new language. The idea is to code a translator application following the client requirements whilst utilising python.

<h2>Scenario</h2>

The purpose of the program is to encourage students to learn new languages. It will have a variety of activities which produce a score to inspire students to aim for higher scores. The program should also have a login system which every student will have a password. Staff will be able to access scores of the class. It should be based similarly on a translator with activities based on English, Italian and Polish. Questions should be randomised, and the application should be compatible on PC/Windows. There should be a password system where each student should have their own login. This as well as the score should be able to be seen by the staff. Staff should be able to change passwords and see how the students are doing.
